            <p>     Hi, I'm Kain, and I'm 25 years old. Back in high school, I took a tech class focused on creating games, 
    which was pretty cool, although it used a different program than what I use now. I was always drawn to 
    web design because I loved the aesthetic it looked so cool and sophisticated.
    I initially went to college for aeronautical engineering and spent a year and a half in that program. 
    Unfortunately, it was shut down, so I shifted my focus to web design. 
    I found a lot of help online and had friends who were really supportive, which made the transition smoother.</p>
    
            <p>
    I do have a habit of procrastinating, which can be quite annoying. However, my strengths lie in my values.
     I deeply care about my family, friends, and maintaining good health. I take care of my parents by cooking, 
     cleaning, and serving them in any way I can. While I love being in my room more than being outside, 
     I'm committed to personal growth and helping those around me.</p>
